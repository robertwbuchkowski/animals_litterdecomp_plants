Data and Model Code for "Nitrogen recycling in coupled green and brown food webs:  weak effects of herbivory and detritivory when nitrogen passes through soil" 

The empirical data from our field experiment are stored in the file: Chapter2_complieddata.csv. The file contains the following columns.

Plot: The plot ID
Label: Whether the added litter was fertilized with 15N directly or not
Treatment: Litter Herbivory history and isopod treatments coded 1-4
Block: Experimental block
Herbivory: Whether the added litter had a history of herbivory
perN: The percent nitrogen by mass of the added litter (averaged by litter type)
LTOUGH: The litter toughness by litter type added

The following columns refer to plots at harvest in the fall:
Det: The mass of detritus (non-treatment) litter in each plot (g)
Litter: The mass of treatment litter in each plot (g)
Plant: The total aboveground plant biomass (g)
Roots: The total root biomass in the top 5cm of soil (g)
Forbs: The aboveground forb biomass (g)
Grass: The aboveground grass biomass (g)
Isopods: The number of isopods recovered from the soil (#)
IsopodsWt: The total mass of isopods recovered form the soil (g)
Worms: The number of worms recovered (g)

The following columns have indications as to the time of measurement:
N_Sol_June: The number of goldenrod stems in June
Theight_Sol_June: The cumulative height of goldenrod stems in June
NE_Oct: The total extractable nitrogen in October
Nitrate_Oct: The total extractable nitrate in October
NE_June: The total extractable N in June
Nitrate_June: The total extractable nitrate in June
SIR_June: Substrate-induced respiration measured in June
SIR_Oct: SIR in October
NitrateS_June: The ion-exchange membrane nitrate in June
NS_June: The ion-exchange membrane total N in June
NitrateS_Oct: The ion-exchange membrane nitrate in October
NS_Oct: The ion-exchange membrane total N in October
